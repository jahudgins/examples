Decisions:
    I think wind should just be a global value instead of a wind field.
    The boat has no way of knowing what the wind is at different locations
    and so it may as well change based on a random gaussian distribution

Questions:
    Degrees or radians?
        If degrees, keep everything in degrees until calling sin/cos
        If radians, keep everything in radians until displaying values
    
    How to structure boats:
        boat pairs (measured, real)
            same class?
            different classes
        real boat contained in measured boat
        subclasses?
    
list of all boats in environment?
id's for boats -- just number in environment list (0 is our boat    
        
keep track of todo:'s in code
